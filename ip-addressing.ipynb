    "- In Class A, the first octet is the network portion /8 while the remaining octects are the host portion\n",
    "- To divide the network, we take the first bit after the network portion and add to the network portion making it /9 this bit is the subnet bit and is 0 for the first subnet giving 50.0.0.0 for the netwrok address\n",
    "- First usable address: Switch the last bit of the host portion to 1 giving 50.0.0.1\n",
    "- Last usable address: will be the opposite of the first usable address. We leave the 9 bits of the network portion unchanged, but change the remaining bits to 1 except for the last bit which will be 0 (i.e broadcast address - 1) giving: 50.127.244.254\n",
